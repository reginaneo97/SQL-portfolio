1. E-commerce trends: Customer Journey & Product Analysis (SQL)
This project demonstrates my ability to analyse user behavior, product performance, and pricing dynamics using SQL on a e-commerce event dataset. I developed a suite of queries to uncover actionable insights across key business areas such as marketing funnels, user engagement, and revenue drivers.

1. [E-commerce Customer Behavior and Product Analysis](https://github.com/reginaneo97/SQL-portfolio/blob/main/Project%201_ecommerce_analysis.sql)

This project analyzes and visualizes customer activity across an e-commerce platform using SQL. It includes metrics such as user engagement, product conversion, price sensitivity, and cross-category behavior.

The dataset is sourced from a simulated e-commerce event log and can be accessed here:
